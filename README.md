# Shift
A puzzle game that challenges even the strongest of players. The objective is to move the hero block to the finish block in as few moves as possible. Every map has a target minimum number of moves, however there are almost always multiple ways of completing a level. Based on how
the player finished the level will determine a 1-3 star scoring, silver or gold prize coins, and unlock the next level!

## Development
The app is written in native android studio. There are over 300 levels all auto generated by a level building algorithm we wrote. The algorithm designs, builds, then solves (recording the moves and steps) a particular level, then transcribes that to a single line text file which is then used by our xml parser to physically create the visual layout of the level for the user. Support has since ended for Shift. The lead developer and funding LLC moved across the country and the team lost interest sadly. However, the game was super fun to both develop and play so its not to say there might be a remake sometime in the future!
